Web security - Basic I think 

Goal is to get passwords from /etc/natas_webpass/ through web interface
Each page you have to get login info that may be shown or access the password directory

Hints without answers: https://onestepcode.com/no-solution-natas-guide-overthewire/

Start login - natas0 - natas0

lvl0 - The password is in html comments - This shit has happened though - I remember some page have people's PII commented
     - gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

lvl1 - Right click blocked - Press Ctrl-Shift-C or f12
     - ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi 

lvl2 - show /files directory via image given
     - users.txt file found containing multiple passwords
     - sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

lvl3 - Says No more info leak. Not even google will find it. 
     - No idea what this meant - I guess something with webscrapping
     - I tried recursive downloading via wget - i thought that would get the directory
     - Looking it up - got hint, https://onestepcode.com/no-solution-natas-guide-overthewire/ 
     - Says what won't a webcrawler find -> robots.txt
     - robots.txt file shows /s3cr3t directory
     - Why doesn't wget recursively get this?
     - Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

lvl4 - Access denied - need to redirect from natat5. 
     - How do I fake my redirect from?
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer
     - Referer in http header says where we are coming from
     - wget -> set --referer=http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ 
     - iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq

lvl5 - view storage in dev mode in chrome
     - loggedin cookies created - has value of 0
     - set value to 1
     - aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

lvl6 - has Input secret with submit button
     - put in pass - got wrong secret 
     - has source code button in bottom right
     - has basic passwd check 
     - loads text from submitted value and some "includes/secret.inc"
     - secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU" as file is viewable from get request 
     - 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9

lvl7 - gives me home and about page
     - These are index.php?page=home or page=about
     - Seems to just be printing contents of the file to webpage
     - page=/etc - waring include(/etc/) failed to open stream no such file/dir
     - Failed opening /etc for inclusion include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear'
     - set page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8 
     - Not sure why directories fail include in php may only be files - This is true
     - DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe

lvl8 - another level 6 with source code
     - Gives encoded secret in code
     - encodes input secret and compares 
     - encoding is base64 -> string reverse -> bin2hex
     - encoded secret == 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362
     - decoded secret == oubWYf2kBq
     - W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl

lvl9 - find words containing with search input
     - gives source code
     - runs passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt"); 
     - $key is input
     - I should be able to pass other arguements to grep
     - I passed * and got the source file
        - I don't know why - probably php thing I don't know
     - empty "" gives me everything in dictionary
     - passed "" /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 to get it to print both files
     - nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu

lvl10 - Same exact thing
      - I think intended solution for previous is too pass semicolon ; or &&
      - Then can run another command to cat files
      - Now replaces ; or & with empty "" - to force? (maybe) the use of grep

lvl11 - Cookies are protected with XOR encryption and gives backcolor setting input with source code
      - xor key hidden
      - Cookie value = ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxFeaAw
      - Decoded value = UK"H+O%pSWh]UZ-T%UhR^,^h7
      - Should be json format so U -> { and 7 -> }
      - This is 01010101 to 01111011 so key of 00101110 which is 0x2E or .
      - This is 00110111 to 01111101 so key of 01001010 which is 0x4A or J
      - Then will contain showpassword and bgcolor
      - K to s - 01001011 -> 01110011 - key == 00111000 / 0x38
      - " to h - 00100010 -> 01101000 - key == 01001010 / 0x4A -- this repeats with one above 
      
      - Decode bad -> raw bytes instead
        0a 55 4b 22 1e 00 48 2b 02 04 4f 25 03 13 1a 70 53 19 57 68 
        5d 55 5a 2d 12 18 54 25 03 55 02 68 52 11 5e 2c 17 11 5e 68 0c
      - 0a -> { (7B) - Key == 71
      - 0c -> } (7D) - Key == 71
      - 55 -> s (73) - Key == 26
      - 4b -> h (68) - Key == 23
      - 22 -> o (6F) - Key == 4D
      - 1e -> w (77) - Key == 69
      - 00 -> p (70) - Key == 70
      - 48 -> a (61) - Key == 29
      - 2b -> s (73) - Key == 58
      - 02 -> s (73) - Key == 71
      - 04 -> w (77) - Key == 73
      - 4f -> o (6F) - Key == 20
      - 25 -> r (72) - Key == 57
      - 03 -> d (64) - Key == 67
      - 13 -> : (3A) - Key == 29

      - Too much - and I messed it up 
      - Wrote python script instead
      - findxor.py -> key is 0x7177384A
      - Use to create new value of cookie in base64 -> ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK
