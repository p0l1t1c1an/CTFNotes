Web security - Basic I think 

I this is a new one for natas as they updated the passwords in the middle of me doing this and I have to redo everything
I don't understand the reason why

Goal is to get passwords from /etc/natas_webpass/ through web interface
Each page you have to get login info that may be shown or access the password directory

Hints without answers: https://onestepcode.com/no-solution-natas-guide-overthewire/

Start login - natas0 - natas0

lvl0 - The password is in html comments - This shit has happened though - I remember some page have people's PII commented
     - g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6

lvl1 - Right click blocked - Press Ctrl-Shift-C or f12
     - h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7

lvl2 - show /files directory via image given
     - users.txt file found containing multiple passwords
     - G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q

lvl3 - Says No more info leak. Not even google will find it. 
     - No idea what this meant - I guess something with webscrapping
     - I tried recursive downloading via wget - i thought that would get the directory
     - Looking it up - got hint, https://onestepcode.com/no-solution-natas-guide-overthewire/ 
     - Says what won't a webcrawler find -> robots.txt
     - robots.txt file shows /s3cr3t directory
     - Why doesn't wget recursively get this?
     - tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm

lvl4 - Access denied - need to redirect from natat5. 
     - How do I fake my redirect from?
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer
     - Referer in http header says where we are coming from
     - wget -> set --referer=http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ 
     - Z0NsrtIkJoKALBCLi5eqFfcRN82Au2oD

lvl5 - view storage in dev mode in chrome
     - loggedin cookies created - has value of 0
     - set value to 1
     - fOIvE0MDtPTgRhqmmvvAOt2EfXR6uQgR

lvl6 - has Input secret with submit button
     - put in pass - got wrong secret 
     - has source code button in bottom right
     - has basic passwd check 
     - loads text from submitted value and some "includes/secret.inc"
     - secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU" as file is viewable from get request 
     - jmxSiH3SP6Sonf8dv66ng8v1cIEdjXWr

lvl7 - gives me home and about page
     - These are index.php?page=home or page=about
     - Seems to just be printing contents of the file to webpage
     - page=/etc - waring include(/etc/) failed to open stream no such file/dir
     - Failed opening /etc for inclusion include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear'
     - set page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8 
     - Not sure why directories fail include in php may only be files - This is true
     - a6bZCNYwdKqN5cGP11ZdtPg0iImQQhAB 

lvl8 - another level 6 with source code
     - Gives encoded secret in code
     - encodes input secret and compares 
     - encoding is base64 -> string reverse -> bin2hex
     - encoded secret == 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362
     - decoded secret == oubWYf2kBq
     - Sda6t0vkOPkM8YeOZkAGVhFoaplvlJFd

lvl9 - find words containing with search input
     - gives source code
     - runs passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt"); 
     - $key is input
     - I should be able to pass other arguements to grep
     - I passed * and got the source file
        - I don't know why - probably php thing I don't know
     - empty "" gives me everything in dictionary
     - passed "" /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 to get it to print both files
     - D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE

lvl10 - Same exact thing
      - I think intended solution for previous is too pass semicolon ; or &&
      - Then can run another command to cat files
      - Now replaces ; or & with empty "" - to force? (maybe) the use of grep
      - 1KFqoJXi6hRaPluAmk8ESDW4fSysRoIg

lvl11 - Cookies are protected with XOR encryption and gives backcolor setting input with source code
      - xor key hidden
      - Cookie value = MGw7JCQ5OC04PT8jOSpqdmkgJ25nbCorKCEkIzlscm5oKC4qLSgubjY
      - Used python scrip tI already made for this 
      - findxor.py -> key is 0x4b4e484c
      - Use to create new value of cookie in base64 -> MGw7JCQ5OC04PT8jOSpqdmk3LT9pYmouLC0nICQ8anZpbS4qLSguKmkz
      - YWqo0pjpcXzSIl5NMAVxg12QxeC1w9QG

lvl12 - Uploading images -- interesting 
      - Source has random alphanumeric generator length 10
      - Makes path with 10 length string and file
      - Found hidden max file size and file name 
      - Setting file name extension sets uploaded file extension
      - Made two php files and uploaded them
      - One is prints directory contents to see if I could read the webpass directory
      - Other is for reading the nata13 password file
      - lW3jYRI02ZKDBb8VtQBU1f6eDRo6WEj9 

lvl13 - Same as 12 now using exif_imagetype to check file 
      - Thought is to prepend php code with jpeg header
      - https://gist.github.com/leommoore/f9e57ba2aa4bf197ebc5
      - Used same php with jpeg magic number prepended
      - qPazSJBmrmU7UQJv17MHk1PGC4DxZMEP

lvl14 - Login system using SQL in PHP
      - Has debug mode
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1833330/how-to-get-php-get-array 
      - Got debug working with changing form to have ?debug appended to the action
      - PHP concat isn't how I thought it worked 
      - Tried setting password to the following
      - "; $query = "SELECT * from users where username = "natas14
        - Was thinking this would overwrite query command
        - No so just invalid sql is passed
      - Figured it out: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_and_or.asp
      - Set password to the following
        - Using the logic operators
        - " or not password="no
      - TTkaI7AWG4iDERztBcEyKV7kRXH1EZRB

lvl15 - Similar but no login 
      - Just checking if user exists
      - Natas16 exists
      - Not sure where password is at first glance
      - https://www.w3schools.com/SQL/sql_like.asp
      - try getting info by pattern matching 
      - something like natas16" and password like "...
        - for username entry
      - Gonna brute force this 
      - Can send request through url
      - Writting python script to just brute force passwd
      - All contained chars: [a, d, f, g, i, j, k, l, q, r, u, A, D, E, H, O, P, R, T, V, Z, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
      - TRD7iZrd5gATjj9PkPEuaOlfEjHqj32V

lvl16 - 9 and 10 but with filtering on input
      - bUt how can we pass it if I can't make grep print the password file
      - it is not filtering $ or () so I should be able to spawn a subshell
        - maybe write to a file and then use that 
        - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118247/echo-bytes-to-a-file
        - Echo bytes to a file that has a quote and then can escape 
        - Nope, I'm stupd or my BS is high, but obviously that wouldn't get considered a quote
      - $(cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas17 > dictionary.txt)
        - did not work, I'm guess the dictionary file is not writable or root owned
      - What information can we pull from the file
        - Basically nothing. A command can pull little information
        - Like if a command suceeds and prints nothing the entire dictionary is printed
        - I could try bruteforcing the password by checking it with grep
        - I will clone my previous code and do it again with grep
    - ^ marks the beginning of line
    - Code does same as 15's but uses grep 
    - XkEuChE0SbnKBvH1RU7ksIb9uuLmI7sd

lvl17 - exact same as 15 but the this user exists message has been removed 
      - It gives no output so how do we check if password is correct pattern match
      - So the text printed out by the debugger comes back as html
      - I can then run scripts using <script> block
      - Trying to see if I can get php variables from Javascript
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/415868/get-variable-from-php-to-javascript
      - This does not seem to work as the browser has no way to interpret the php 
      - Used hint: Is it possible to make queries take longer based on the query results?
      - Had to learn a lot of SQL 
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15683185/if-else-in-where-clause-mysql
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284524/how-and-when-to-use-sleep-correctly-in-mysql
      - Use natas15 to check code validity
      - Basically just next if statements with the actual request I want to handle to get the password
      - if the first if succeeds then it exists otherwise it doesn't 
      - Sleep 2 seconds if the user+pass exists
      - 8NEDUUxg8kFgPV84uLwvZkGn6okJQ6aq

lvl18 - Source code given for user login page
      - Sets up php session with user
      - Seems to block admin access as it would also seemingly be 0 for any session created
      - Uses some session cookie which I can modify in my browser 
      - That bypasses the login screen as every session seems to kinda just already exist
      - Gives you random id and you interact with that one
      - Wrote sh script to curl the page and brute force the small range of php sessions (640) 
      - Session: 119
      - 8LMJEhKFbMKIL2mxQKjv0aEDdk7zpT0s

lvl19 - 3338302d61646d696e == admin
      - stays the same with entering new account need to refresh
      - 3231362d61646d696e == after reseting admin
      - 353734 2d 796573 == yes
      - 343733 2d 796573 == yes
      - 313631 2d 796573 == yes

      - So the last character are the username hex
      - 2d seems to be constant (it is a hyphen)
      - the first 3 hex numbers are actually just 0-9 
      - Comes out as "###-{username}"
      - Makes new one each time
      - Admin might have one stored with username as admin
      
      - Shell/Python script to try bruteforcing and printing password
      - Session Cookie: 3238312d61646d696e or 281-admin
      - guVaZ3ET35LbgbFMoaN5tFcYT1jEP7UH

lvl20 - Input asks for username 
      - gets b3h863b7r1i5alpjqpgv74ept3 with admin
      - second time after deleteing gets lum2qp8eai77kbn84i6m9alcts w/ admin
      - some session set save handler - idk look it up
      - sets functions to store sessions for user
      - only using read and write
      - MYWRITE 55rtlr23b6u77u34o52nt56hrf name|s:4:"root";
      - encoding for session?
      - It just generates one with no data q06i56gh2sf19f4hvaigvo0rqk
                                      - OR p8slku7ca51p915bdu7vdk4hc2
      - Maybe the alphanumeric encoding does not matter
      - May be the fields inside matter - ie not trying to bruteforce like previous 
      - Rather add fields to be written to add an admin field or something
      - Tried input of "; admin|s:1:"1 which did not work
      - It specifies size of the string
      - How is it getting that?
      - Trying script to input newline char
      
      - Script got 2 separate reads 
      - Read [name admin";]<br>DEBUG: Read [admin|s:1:"1]<br><br />
      - How to format though
      - $data .= "$key $value\n"
      - I think this is how its formatted, helps to read the source code provided in depth
